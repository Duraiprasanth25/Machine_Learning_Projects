# BengaluruHousePricePrediction

This data science project series demonstrates the step-by-step process of creating a real estate price predictionÂ website. We begin by building a model with sklearn and linear regression using the Bangalore house prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step is to create a Python flask server that utilizes the stored model to deliver http requests. The third component is a website built using html, css, and javascript that allows users to enter house square footage, bedrooms, and other information, after which it calls the Python flask server to receive the predicted price. During model building, we will cover practically all data science methods such as data load and cleaning, detecting outliers and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross validation,etc. 

Technology and tools wise this project covers,

- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
- Python flask for http server
- HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
